# Tag Components

This project is an experiment to define web components in a declarative way. It introduces the new tag `<component>` to HTML. It also implements a polyfill, see  `component-polyfill.js`.

### How to use?
Just add this script tag in the <head> of your HMTL, like this:
```html
 <head>
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/emanuelhfarias/tag-components/component-polyfill.js"></script>
 </head>
```
