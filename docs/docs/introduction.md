This project is an experiment to define web components in a declarative way.
It introduces the new tag `<component>` to HTML.

Imagine you can define a web component like this:

import ShowExample from './show-example'

<ShowExample file="awesome-alert.html" />

### Result:

import LoadExample from './load-example'

<LoadExample file="awesome-alert.html" />

The example above shows us:
1. we can declarative define a new custom element using `<component>` tag;
2. extends attribute means that the root element of Shadow Tree will be a `p` element;
3. we can style elements inside a component without affecting it outside of the component.

That's great because now we can create small components just for styling pourpose.
Reducing CSS classes from elements turns our templates much more readable. See the comparison:

```html
<alert-box success>message</alert-box>

versus

<div class="alert alert-success">message</div>
```

We can see this phenomenon in [style-components](https://styled-components.com) community. People are making small components
just for styling pourpose and making templates more readable.

`tag-components` are not just for slyling one element. In fact, it also support **template** and **script**, but none of them are required:

<ShowExample file="component-structure.html" />

### Installing

Are you interesting in using this? Just add this Polyfill in the `<head>` of your HMTL, like this:

```html
 <head>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/tag-components@0.1.2/component-polyfill.js"></script>
 </head>
```

PS: we will use the words `components` and `custom elements` interchangeably in this website.
